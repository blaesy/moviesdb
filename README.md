# MOVIESDB Installation
In order for the website to fully work & load, you need to obtain *api_key* from [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org). Upon getting the *api_key*, you need to add it to your **.env** file that should be located in the root folder of the project.

### Example of .env
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=[YOUR_KEY]
```
